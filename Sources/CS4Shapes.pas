     The easy way to define a font typeface is by using the

     The chars are indexed by their <I=ASCII> value. If a char
     is not defined, it will not be drawed and an underline will
     be shown.

     The space and carriage returns are handled automatically,

     system with an <I=Index>, that is used to save and retrieve
     the font from the disk and associate the correct font to
     the texts.

     If you change the indexes among different drawings, you
     could load the wrong file. In this case you will notice that
