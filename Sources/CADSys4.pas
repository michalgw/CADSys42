{: This help file explain all the classes and functions defined in
   the CADSys 4.0 library for both the 2D and 3D use.

   These classes and functions are defined in the CADSys4 unit file
   that you must include in the <B=uses> clause in all of your units
   that access the types and functions of the library.
   For the forms there is no need to manually add CADSys4 if you
   place the controls of the library on them.

   <Title=CADSys 4.0 v 2.0>
   <H1=This help file was created by HelpCreator by Piero Valagussa,
   using an automatic in-source documentation extractor for Delphi.>

   <B=Units><BR>

   <See Unit=CS4Tasks><BR>

   This is the help file for the CADSys 4.0 library, a complete
   2D/3D vectorial graphic library in floating point precision.
   By using the library you can create exciting and powerful
   CAD-like interfaces to your programs.

   So you can present application data to the user in a more
   abstract ways like flow-charts, virtual enviroment, command
   and control and so on.
   The flexibility of the library let you to define new shapes
   and interactive operations with a little effort (compared to
   create a new library from scratch).

   The library cames with all the sources of the controls, components,
   graphical objects and tasks, and only need a separate DLL (CADSys4.dll)
   to work.
   This is not a library that do all the things for you, you have
   to write simple Object Pascal code in order to create the
   CAD-like interface. As you may seen from the accompaning examples,
   however, this is not a difficult thing to do.

   I hope the library will fit your requirements but if you
   have suggestion or bugs reports please contact me at the
   address <Code=pivalag@@tin.it>.

   <BOX=<I=Piero Valagussa owns this help file and the library itself, and
   retains all the rights.>.>

{: This property may be used to store some user's defined data
   like object references.
   It is not used by the library.

   One of the most useful use of this property is when you need to
   link an object to a shape. Consider for example that you have
   a class TSurface in which you store informations like the
   reflectivity coefficent, the color for rendering, the adiacent
   surfaces and the points of the surface. The instances of this class
   are managed by the program that save them and so on. You need of
   course to draw them and manage them interactively (you may want to
   do that instead to change them through the list of points).

   The library can help you in this, bacause you can use the <See Class=TFace3D>
   shape that cames whith the library and that has a list of points and
   that is drawed and managed interactively by the various interaction tasks
   of the library. However if you naive add an instance of TFace3D and
   an instance of TSurface and link them through the ID property of TFace3D,
   you will have duplication of data and a difficult task to syncronize the
   two instances. A better approach is to store the TSurface reference into
   the Tag property and a TFace3D reference in the TSurface instance.
   After that you have to move any geometric datas from TSurface to the TFace3D.
   In our example simply use the TFace3D to store the points and normal, instead
   use the TSurface to store color and coefficients.
   In this way whenever the user modify the shape, the TSurface is automatically
   updated. If there is some data in TSurface that depends on the datas of TFace3D
   (for instance a baricentric point) you have two way to update this data:

   <LI=Derive from TFace3D a new shape with the added data>
   <LI=Put the data in TSurface and the add an event handler that will be
   used for the <See Property=TGraphicObject@OnChange> event>

   With the second solution whenever the points are moved the new
   baricentric point will be calculated.

   This is only a simple and not optimized way to handle these problems.

{: This is a non visual control that is used to store and manage the list
   of graphic objects that defines a draw.

   TCADCmp is an asbtract class use to define a common interface for
   drawing management. In fact the control is not useble by itself
   because it doesn't specify the kind of objects that can be stored,
   but only assest what kind of operation are necessary for storing
   general graphic objects.

   Basically this control is used to store a list of objects that must
   be drawed. Until you define a viewport from which see the objects
   these objects are only stored in a list that will be traversed to
   produce a draw as soon as you have defined such a viewport (see
   <See Class=TCADViewport>) by linking a viewport control to the
   TCADCmp (see <See Property=TCADViewport@CADCmp>).

   The first thing you must define is the kind of objects you want to
   use:

   <LI=If you want to create 2D drawings use the control
       <See Class=TCADCmp2D> >
   <LI=If you want to create 3D drawings use the control
       <See Class=TCADCmp3D> >

   these specific controls are derived from this one implementing
   the abstract method to handle 2D or 3D objects.

   This control handles also the PERSISTANCE of the draw, giving
   method to save and retrive the list of objects from a stream or
   a file (see <See=Object's Persistance@PERSISTANCE>). The use of polymorphism and
   class references made possible to add your own shape classes
   that will be considered as much the same as the native ones.

   Think about this control as a TDataSet for a Database application.

   <B=Note>: You don't need to derive from this control because the
   library has already the two controls you need to handle 2D and
   3D drawing. You may want to derive from this control to improve
   its list management or to implement ordered display lists for
   special 3D operation (like implementing spatial partitioning
   with BSP).

  {: This class defines a viewport with which it is possible to render
     the contents of a CAD control. This is a visual component.

     The viewport is a 2D windows through which you can see a virtual world.
     The world is stored in a <See Class=TCADCmp> control as a list (display list)
     of graphic objects. The world used here is dimension less, so this component
     is not directly usable but it defines only an abstract interface.

     Regardless the kind of world (2d, 3d or more) a viewport is always a window
     on which the world is projected. The view trasformation has two
     components:

     <LI=the first one project the world on the window plane. If the world
         is already 2D this is a simple identity transform (Projection) >
     <LI=the second one project the window plane onto a portion on the canvas
         of the control (Mapping).>

     This control defines and uses only the second component of the transformation
     (see <See Method=TCADViewport@BuildViewportTransform>). The other one is
     dimension dependent and so must be defined in derived classes.

     You manage the window position and size (that is modify the second component
     of the above transformations) using the property
     <See Property=TCADViewport@VisualRect>, that is the portion of the
     window plane that you see on the canvas of the control.
     You change the VisualRect using the zooming methods (see
     <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomIn>, <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomOut>,
     <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomWindow>, <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomToExtension>
     <See Method=TCADViewport@PanWindow> and <See Method=TCADViewport@MoveWindow>).
     All of these changes the mapping transformation (the second component explained
     above).

     A viewport use a back buffer to store the current rapresentation of the
     CADCmp display list. When you start a <See Method=TCADViewport@Repaint>,
     this buffer is created and copied on the canvas of the control.
     The repaint can use a thread (painting thread) to allow the user to stop
     the operation at any time. However using a thread require some additional
     steps that require a bit of time, so it is advisable to use the thread
     (see <See Property=TCADViewport@UsePaintingThread>) only when you have
     a complex draw made up of thousand of objects.
     During the repaint process you can also copy the buffer content on the
     on screen canvas when a prestabilited number of objects (see
     <See Property=TCADViewport@CopingFrequency> property) is drawed. This
     gives a useful feedback to the user.

  {: A <I=2D graphic object> is a graphic object that is defined on
     a 2D plane.

     The 2D object is defined in a special coordinate system referred
     here as the <I=model coordinate system or model system>. When an object is used by the
     library, the world coordinate system (or world system) are
     needed instead. So the object in model system is transformed by an
     matrix transform to obtain the object in the world system.
     This transform is called the <See Property=TObject2D@ModelTransform>.
     So when an object is drawed, for example, its points are first
     transformed from model system to world system by using this matrix,
     then the view transform (that the concatenation of the
     projection matrix with the mapping matrix) tranform these points
     to obtain the points in the screen system that are easily displayed.

     The 2D object has a 2D bounding box, that is the smallest
     axis aligned rectangle that fully contains the object.
     This rectangle is always in the world coordinate system and
     so it doesn't depend on the model transform. The bounding box
     must be computed in the
     <See Property=TGraphicObject@_UpdateExtension> method that have
     to be redefined.

     The model matrix is split in two parts. The first one, called
     the <I=current model matrix>, can be removed at any time or
     can be post multiplied with a new one.

     The second one, called the <I=saved model matrix>, is stored

     by using the <See Method=TObject2D@RemoveTransform> method

     The actual model matrix is the concatenation of the

   {: A <I=3D graphic object> is a graphic object that is defined in
     a 3D world.

     The 3D object is defined in a special coordinate system referred
     here as the <I=model coordinate system or model system>. When an object
     is used by the library, the <I=world coordinate system (or world system)>
     are needed instead. So the object in model system is transformed
     by a transform matrix to obtain the object in the world system.
     This transform is called the <See Property=TObject3D@ModelTransform>.
     So when an object is drawed, for example, its points are first
     transformed from model system to world system by using this matrix,
     then the points are projected on the view plane and normalized
     (see <See Class=TCADViewport3D> for details),
     and finally they are mapped to the screen system and displayed
     (by using clipping in homogeneous coordinates).

     The 3D object has a 3D bounding box, that is the smallest
     axis aligned box that fully contains the object.
     This box is always in the world coordinate system and
     so it doesn't depend on the model transform. The bounding box
     must be computed in the
     <See Property=TGraphicObject@_UpdateExtension> method that have
     to be redefined.

     The model matrix is split in two parts. The first one, called
     the <I=current model matrix>, can be removed at any time or
     can be post multiplied with a new one.

     The second one, called the <I=saved model matrix>, is stored
     permanently inside the object and can only be removed
     by using the <See Method=TObject3D@RemoveTransform> method
     or substituted with the actual model matrix with the
     <See Method=TObject3D@ApplyTransform> method.
     The actual model matrix is the concatenation of the
     <I=saved model matrix> with the <I=current model matrix> in
     this order (remember that the order of concatenation of transform matrix
     is important).

     The presence of the <I=current model matrix> is helpfull to
     create operations that transform an object interactilvely and
     that can be cancelled if they are not what the user want to do.

     <B=Note>: To save space the <I=current model matrix> and the

  {: This component implements a 3D viewport that is control that
     display the contents of a <See Class=TCADCmp3D> component.

     A 3D viewport acts as a <I=camera> that can be positioned and
     aimed in the world, and when it is positioned you can shoot
     photos. As with a camera you have to select where the camera is
     and where it look, as well as where is its up vector.
     In this control all of these property must be set before a
     scene has to be viewed.

     A way to setup the camera is to specify the parameters
     for a 3D plane on which the CAD contents will be projected
     (called here <I=projection plane or view plane>). When the
     objects are projected, the projection plane is mapped on
     the screen and you can see a 2D representation of the world.

     To define the plane are needed:
     <LI=A point on the projection plane (<I=VRP>).
       This point is the origin of the coordinate system on the plane
       (or <I=view plane coordinate system>). This specifies also
       the <I=center of projection>.>
     <LI=A normal to the plane (<I=VPN>).
       This versor points in the opposite direction to the view
       direction. That is if it is set to (-1, 0, 0) we are looking
       forward the X axis in the direction (1, 0, 0).>
     <LI=A UP versor (<I=VUP>). It defines the Y direction of the
     view plane coordinate system. It can be thought as the vertical
     side of the postcard obtained through the camera.>

     The dimension of the postcard are specified by the
     <See Property=TCADViewport@VisualRect> property.

     The other way to setup the camera is by means of the
     <See Method=TCADViewport3D@SetCamera> method and
     <See Method=TCADPerspectiveViewport3D@SetFieldOfView> method.

     In addition to the above parameters the following parameters
     are also needed:
     <LI=<See Property=TCADViewport3D@FrontClip>. It defines
     the fartest distance besides which the objects are no
     drawed. If an object crosses this plane it will be clipped.>
     <LI=<See Property=TCADViewport3D@BackClip>. It defines
     the nearest distance in front of which the objects are
     no drawed. If an object crosses this plane it will be clipped.>

     Both distances are positive away the view direction.

     In order to draw an object, the following operation are
     performed by the viewport and the object:

     <LI=The object is transformed by a roto-translation
     (<I=Orientation transform matrix>) that
     position it with respect to the view plane coordinate
     system (<See Property=TCADViewport3D@ViewOrientation>) transform.
     This transform the world coordinate system into the
     view plane coordinate system.>
     <LI=The object is projected and normalized using the
     <See Property=TCADViewport3D@ViewNormalization> transform. This
     transform the view plane coordinate system into the
     normalized view volume.>
     <LI=The homogeneous clipping is applied to the object.>
     <LI=The clipped object is mapped on the control canvas
     using the <See Property=TCADViewport3D@ViewMapping> transform.>

     <See Class=TCADPrg> is based on a <I=FSM model> (finite state
     machine) in which an interaction task is is a set of states,
     each of them execute some part of the whole task.
     The interaction task (from now on simply a task) evolves through
     the states in respons to <I=events>. An <I=event> is some action
     on the CADPrg or the linked Viewport performed by the user or
     by the control itself.
     A task is an <I=active state>, that is the state with receives
     the events (through the implementation of the
     <See Method=TCADState@OnEvent>).
     The active state decides what operation performs in response to
     the event. See <See Method=TCADState@OnEvent> for details.

     The events are (see also TCADPrgEvent) <I=mouse events, keyboard
     events, expose events and user events>.

     The user must derives its states from this class to implement
     an interaction task. A state may be reused in more that one
     interaction task.

     An interaction task is started by using the
     <See Method=TCADPrg@StartOperation>,
     <See Method=TCADPrg@SuspendOperation> and passing it the first
     state of it.

     To define a state you may want to implement the following
     methods:

     <LI=<See Method=TCADState@Create> in which you place the
       initialization code for the state>
     <LI=<See Method=TCADState@OnEvent> in which you place the

     A working plane is a special plane oriented in the space
     that is used as a reference for all drawings on the viewport.
     If a working plane is in use, the mouse position is
     projected on that plane using the <I=projectors> of the
     projection and so you are sure that any changing in the
     view point doesn't change the plane on which you are
     drawing.

     For instance if you are looking from a point that forms
     an angle 45° with the X-Y plane, if you set the working
     plane to be equal to the X-Y plane all the mouse movements
     will lies on that plane. If you change the angle of view,
     the mouse will again be keept on that plane.

     Of course if you set the working plane to be equal to
     the X-Y plane and you are looking from the X axis, unexpected
     results may be possible.

  The 3D world is projected on a plane called the view-plane. Is
  also defined a view-volume, that is a volume that bound the object
  projected on the view-plane.

  VRP is the view-reference-point, that is a point on the view plane.
      It can be any point in the 3D space.
  VPN is the view-plane-normal, that is a versor (direction) that
      orients the view-plane.
  VUP is the up vector (see Window).
  Window is a viewport on the view-plane. It's also define the view-volume.
         The window is defined on the view-plane coordinates. The origin
         of this coordinates is VRP.
         VPN is the z axis of the view-plane coords. VUP is the y axis.
         The x axis is found considering a right-handed system.
  PRP is the center of projection in the case of perspective projection.
  F is the front clipping plane that is the first plane encoutered along
    VPN. If it is referred to VRP. If it is positive the the objects
    behind the observer are projected.
  B is the back clipping plane. A large value ensure that all the object
    in front of the observer are displaied.

  At the moment only non-oblique projection are considered.
  Guardo nel verso negativo dell'asse z.
