  OffScreenCanvas

- Added the ClipRect2D parameter to DrawObject and 
  DrawObjectWithRubber of TCADViewport and its descendant
- All the base 2D/3D engine code is now moved to a dll that must be
  installed in the System directory of Windows. So now all the
  sources, except the code in the DLL, are avaiable to the developer
  that can customize the components/controls/shapes of CADSys.
- Fixed the format for the version of CADSys drawing files. Now the
  version string must follow the rule: CAD<MajorVer><MinorVer><Build>
  The library has now the following marker: CAD422
- The grid property is now subdivided in four different parts:
  - GridDeltaX, GridDeltaY are equivalent to GridStep property
  - GridSubX, GridSubY are the number of subdivision of GridDelta?
  For example the following configuration:
  - GridDeltaX=10, GridDeltaY=10, GridSubX=5, GridSubY=5
  means a grid with a step of 10units along X and Y, and every 2
  units a dotted line.
